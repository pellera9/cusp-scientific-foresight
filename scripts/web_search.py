Rewrite the following question into a high-quality web search query optimized for information retrieval.

Guidelines:
- Include key entities, technical terms, and domain-specific keywords
- Add clarifying context if the question is ambiguous
- Prefer precise terminology over vague phrasing
- Avoid conversational or filler words
- Expand with relevant synonyms or related terms if helpful
- Do NOT include time-based words like "latest", "recent"

Output:
- A single optimized search query (not a sentence, no explanation)
